# PAIN Protocol

**PAIN (Programmable AI-powered Interoperable Network)** is an intelligent, modular protocol designed to route global payments across CBDCs, stablecoins, bank APIs, and cash agentsâ€”while enforcing compliance, optimizing FX timing, and anchoring transaction logs.

This is a **working prototype (v0.1)** featuring:
- Mariaâ€™s CBDC-based remittance flow (UAE â†’ PH)
- Aishaâ€™s split freelancer payout (convert + savings)
- AI FX prediction
- Smart routing engine
- DID-compatible compliance logic (basic)
- Anchored transaction receipts in JSON

---

## Why PAIN?

> Because moving money across borders shouldnâ€™t be expensive, complex, or legally risky.

PAIN helps:
- Individuals: send money affordably and safely
- Freelancers: save + convert with smart FX
- CFOs/SMEs: simulate optimal FX timing (coming soon)
- NGOs: deliver aid to verified recipients (upcoming)
