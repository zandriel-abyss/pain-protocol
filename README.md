# PAIN Protocol

**PAIN (Programmable AI-powered Interoperable Network)** is an intelligent, modular protocol designed to route global payments across CBDCs, stablecoins, bank APIs, and cash agentsâ€”while enforcing compliance, optimizing FX timing, and anchoring transaction logs.

This is a **working prototype (v0.1)** featuring:
- Mariaâ€™s CBDC-based remittance flow (UAE â†’ PH)
- Aishaâ€™s split freelancer payout (convert + savings)
- AI FX prediction (rule-based for now, ML-ready)
- Smart routing engine with real-time rail fallback
- DID-compatible compliance logic (basic)
- Anchored transaction receipts in JSON
- NGO batch payout simulation (multi-send)
- Rail registry + outage simulator
- Notebook-based fallback test suite

## Why PAIN?

> Because moving money across borders shouldnâ€™t be expensive, complex, or legally risky.

PAIN helps:
- Individuals: send money affordably and safely
- Freelancers: save + convert with smart FX
- CFOs/SMEs: simulate optimal FX timing (coming soon)
- NGOs: deliver aid to verified recipients with programmable rails
- Governments: disburse programmable CBDC (with voucher logic)

## Running a Flow

### Mariaâ€™s Flow (CBDC remittance)
```bash
python usecases/remittance-maria/run_maria_flow.py
```

### Aishaâ€™s Flow (freelancer split payment)
```bash
python usecases/freelancer-aisha/run_aisha_flow.py
```

### NGO Batch Payout (multi-send simulation)
```bash
python payment-rails/multi_payout_simulator.py
```

Anchored receipts are saved to:
```
logs/anchored_receipts.json
```

## Milestone
This is **PAIN Protocol v0.1** â€“ a working demo of programmable money flows with:
- Routing intelligence
- CBDC + stablecoin + fallback delivery
- Anchored audit logs
- Rule-based FX optimization

### âœ… Upcoming in v0.2:
- Voucher flows (Tunde)
- Programmable disbursement logic
